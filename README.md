<font color="red"><b><h3>Introduction</h3></b></font>
<p> Water is a important natural resource. It is diffucult to imagine life without water.<br>almost all life activities are carried out with the help of water. These activities will be <br> disrupted in thr absence of water.</P>
<font color="red"><b><h3>Water Recources</b></h3></font>
<p> These are two main sources of water-surface water and underground water </p>
<font color="red"><b><h3>Surface water</b></h3></font>
<p> The water present on the surface of the earth is called surface water. Depending upon its<br> purity,surface water is divided into three types.</p>
<font color="blue"><b><h3>Rainwater</b></h3></font>
<p> Rainwater is considered to be the purest for of natural water.<br> It gets collected in ponds,lakes,river and seas. The<br> first shower of rain brings down dust particles,smoke,chemicals<br> and disolved gases present in the atmosphere. however<br> subsequent showers are free from impurities. every effort should<br> be made to store and use rainwater as much as possible.
<font color="blue"><b><h3>River and lake water</b></h3></font>
<p> Water in rivers and lake comes from rain, and melting of snow or ice on mountains.<br>River and lake water is used in agricultural fields and for drinking purposes. It contains<br> germs,mud,clay,sand,dissolved salts and other suspended impurities. So,it has to be<br> purified to make it fit for consuption and domestic use.
<font color="blue"<b><h3>Sea and ocean water</b></h3></font>
<p> the water from rivers ultimately flows into seas and ocean. Seas and ocean are the<br> largest sources of water on the Earth. Sea water contains a large amount of dissolved salts<br> (aproximately 3.5%) in it thus, sea water is called saline water and is salty to taste.<br> The concentration of salt in sea water is called salinity of sea water. it is unfit for<br> drinking and irrigation purposes. it has to be desalinated before making it suitable for<br> domestic use.<p>
